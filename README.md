# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression

A Machine Learning Model that detects breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predicts whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based on its characteristics.

This model can identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or malignant).

1. Clump thickness
2. Uniformity of cell size
3. Uniformity of cell shape
4. Marginal adhesion
5. Single epithelial cell
6. Bare Nuclei
7. Bland chromatin
8. Normal nucleoli
9. Mitoses
